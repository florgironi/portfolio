Welcome to my website, a space where I share my professional and personal journey. Here, you can learn about who I am, what inspires me, and how I have specialized in development and data analysis. I designed this page from scratch, using semantic HTML to enhance visibility in search engines and ensure that all goals are correctly implemented.

To guarantee the best possible experience, I conducted a thorough analysis with LightHouse, evaluating performance, accessibility, SEO, and following optimization recommendations. All of this was done with the aim of offering a perfectly optimized and functional website.

Previously, I worked as a frontend developer, but my current focus is on data analysis. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
